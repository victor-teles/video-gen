## [2.0.5] - 2025-01-XX - CAPTION TIMING SYNCHRONIZATION FIX

### Fixed
#### Faceless Video Caption Timing Accuracy
- **MAJOR FIX**: Completely rebuilt caption generation for accurate word-level timing synchronization
- **Issue**: Captions were not synchronized with actual spoken words in the video
- **Root Cause**: Caption timing was based on estimated word durations instead of actual TTS audio timing
- **Solution**: Integrated WhisperX transcription of generated TTS audio for precise word timing

#### Technical Implementation
- **WhisperX Integration**: Added real-time transcription of generated TTS audio files
- **Audio Concatenation**: Combine all scene audio files for complete transcription
- **Word Mapping Algorithm**: Proportional mapping of transcribed words back to original scenes
- **Timing Synchronization**: Use actual audio durations instead of estimated scene durations
- **Fallback System**: Robust fallback to estimated timing if transcription fails

#### Caption Generation Pipeline
1. **Scene Audio Analysis**: Extract actual duration from each TTS audio file
2. **Timeline Calculation**: Update scene start/end times based on real audio durations
3. **Audio Concatenation**: Combine all scene audio for full video transcription
4. **WhisperX Transcription**: Get word-level timestamps from actual spoken audio
5. **Word Mapping**: Map transcribed words back to original scene structure
6. **JSON Generation**: Create properly synchronized caption file

#### Output Format Validation
- **Exact Format Match**: Generated captions now match user's required format perfectly
- **Precise Timing**: Word start/end times synchronized with actual speech
- **Scene Segmentation**: Proper segment boundaries based on actual audio timing
- **Word-Level Accuracy**: Individual word timestamps aligned with spoken content

### Technical Details
#### New Methods
- `generate_caption_json()`: Complete rewrite with WhisperX integration
- `_generate_fallback_captions()`: Robust fallback for transcription failures
- Enhanced `create_video()`: Audio duration calculation before caption generation

#### Improved Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if audio files are missing or corrupted
- Proportional word mapping handles transcription variations
- Memory cleanup for temporary audio concatenation files
- Comprehensive logging for debugging timing issues

#### Performance Optimizations
- Temporary file management for audio concatenation
- Immediate cleanup of audio clips to prevent memory leaks
- Efficient word mapping algorithms
- Minimal impact on overall generation time

### Impact
- **Caption Accuracy**: Words now appear exactly when spoken in the video
- **User Experience**: Captions properly synchronized for all faceless videos
- **Format Compliance**: Output matches exact user requirements
- **Reliability**: Robust system with proper fallback mechanisms
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality preserved

### Validation
- Comprehensive testing with word-level timing verification
- Format validation against user's required JSON structure
- Multiple test scenarios including edge cases
- Performance testing with various video lengths
